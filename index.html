              <h2>Hi there!</h2>
              <b>My name is Cherie.</b> Yes, it's pronounced like 'Sherry'.<br/> It's okay,
              Starbucks misspells it all the time too.<br/><br/>
              Born in Canada with a Chinese heritage, I've spent the majority of my
              life in Seattle, Washington. So naturally, I have developed a strong coffee 
              addiction (that is <i>completely</i> under-control), an enthusiasm for gorgeous mountains 
              and endless bodies of water, and a mediocre tolerance for rain. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I am currently a student at the University of Washington, where I am pursuing degrees 
              in Computer Science and Informatics. As reflected in my college career, not only do I love 
              software development itself, but I am particularly interested in the product's impact on society. 
              A budding full-stack developer, I aim to build software that solves today's pressing problems, 
              and use technology to simplify people's lives.
              <br/>
              <br> 
              Two years ago, I found the perfect job that blended my two passions: helping others, and blabbing about 
              how <i>cool</i> programming is. As a teaching assistant for the Introductory Programming series at UW, I have 
              absolutely enjoyed watching previously non-technical students fall in love with computer science. I now 
              hold a management-heavy role, where I interview, hire, and train new TAs each quarter, and ensure 
              that our TAs are teaching at a high standard.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I am also a <a href="http://scholars.tune.com/">TUNE House Scholar</a>, which is an incredible 
              scholarship that provides housing, mentorship, and tech workshops for eight undergraduate women 
              studying Computer Science at UW. This program has supported and empowered me to pursue the 
              technology industry despite under-representation, and I am endlessly grateful for the opportunities 
              it has given me (like 
              <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-more-women-computing-better-both-melinda-gates/">
                meeting Melinda Gates</a>!).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Because society jokes that millenials can't pull themselves away from their computers, I feel 
              obligated to mention that I am a runner, a sunset-enthusiast, and a 
              strong-willed dog person. I thrive in sunshine and quaint coffee shops, speak
              conversational Mandarin at about a 4th grade level, and am a die-hard Taylor Swift fan. I have a stubborn sweet-tooth and 
              am always looking for new dessert shops to try, so if you have any recommendations, let me know.
              
              <br/>
